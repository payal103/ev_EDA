The chart above shows the **distribution of charger types** in the dataset:

* **AC Level 2** is the most common.
* **DC Fast Chargers** are widely used but less than Level 2.
* **AC Level 1** chargers are the least common.

This reflects real-world trends where Level 2 chargers are most popular for public and residential use, while DC Fast Chargers are typically used on highways or high-traffic areas.

**Usage Stats vs Charging Capacity**.

The scatter plot reveals the following:

* **Higher charging capacities (e.g., 350 kW)** generally attract **more users per day**, especially for **DC Fast Chargers**.
* **AC Level 1 and Level 2** chargers typically serve fewer users, consistent with their lower power output.
* There's a positive trend: **more capacity â†’ more usage**, but with some overlap.
